  <h1> JPEG
  <p> A JPEG file (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is used for compressing images. It's best for static images that don't move.</p>
  <h2> GIF
    <p> A GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) is an image file that supports animated and static images. It's best for both animated images and images that don't move. </p>
    <h3> PNG
    <p> A PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is sort of like an improved version of a GIF. It's also best for moving pictures.</p> </h3>
