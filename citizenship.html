  <h1>Citizenship</h1>
<p>Citizenship is composed of multiple traits. Honesty, compassion, responsibility, and courage are only a few, but they are important when referring to the definition of citizenship.</p>
<h2>Honesty</h2>
<p> Honesty is important in terms of citizenship because when citizens of a community are honest with eachother, they will know to tell the truth, which is vital for a community, no matter how small it is. A community that's full of people who aren't honest with eachother will never function to its full potential.
<h3> Compassion</h3>
<p> Compassion is also an important component to being a good citizen. Caring for the other people in your community and showing compassion for eachother during times of need will strengthen a community, and is a very large portion of the many ways to be a good citizen, and to perform citizenship effectively.</p>
<h4> Respect </h4>
<p>Much like compassion, respect within a community is an important aspect of citizenship. Respect and compassion really go hand in hand. Respecting others, their actions and opinions is a sign of being a good citizen and a sign of executing citizenship to the best of your ability. Respecting one another lets everyone know that everyone within the community are equals.</p>
<h5> Responsibility </h5>
<p> Responsibility is yet another important aspect of performing citizenship effectively. Being responsible for yourself and carrying your own weight within a community is vital in having a successful community and being a good citizen. It's important to be independent, while also looking out for other members of your community. Being responsible for yourself, while also being responsible for members of your community and taking care of them is another way to perform citizenship. </p>
<h6> Courage </h6>
<p> Being courageous makes a community strong if citizens execute courage often. Sticking up for one another during times of need and being courageous individually makes the citizens within a community bond, and being courageous for your community is yet another way to perform citizenship.</p>
<h7> Inclusion </h7>
<p> Another important aspect of performing citizenship in my opinion is inclusion. It's important to make the citizens of a community feel welcome, or no one will be able to achieve any of the other traits that define citizenship. Including new people into a community is a very important aspect of citizenship. </p>
<h8> A Time I Saw Citizenship </h8>
<p> I believe that there's been a lot of examples of citizenship throughout America lately, especially with everything that is occuring in a political sense. People have started banding together and executing all of the traits that I've described above to try and bring this nation to a place of peace and harmony. A specific event I can recall was the protest in the Boston Commons a few weeks ago that was against a group of hate. Citizens courageously came together to combat hatred and bigotry and to make the city of Boston a more comfortable community for anyone of any kind to live in. That's a strong example of citizenship that I've had the honor to witness.</p>
